/* delete appinstantiate, replace with just router
/* need to have some sort entry point, this would act as an Instantiate
/* route.js and page should join, or some sort of combination of the two => route.js is now page.js
add a feature in router where a router could nested or some sort of groupings
add an authen in the app

for the routes, instead of just Instance of Pages, use the Instance of the dedicated Page e.g. 'class Home', 'class about'

/* App.js is the only main entry point, create its own class that is a modified version of page,
    /*- in App class, this is where you would enable the Router class

/*Using the router, it should have a definitive entry point, router-viewer

displaying in router-viewer should be the direct router-viewer to enable nesting of routers or the nearest/direct element
 /*- use the inherited page class to gain access to parent class
 /*- the listed routes should be objects, not classes, it would only create an instance once it has been click
